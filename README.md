# Conlang Generator
A simple conlang generator designed for my Master's project. The goal was to examine the believability of RNG-based syntax. When run, the program produces a few paragraphs of gibberish, that should theoretically follow syntactic principles. Also included is a simple snippet to run some classification analysis on sample text outputs.
